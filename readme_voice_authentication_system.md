# 🔒 Voice Authentication System

> **Secure, real-time, AI-powered voice authentication** — combining deep learning, signal processing, and biometric spoof detection for next‑generation access control.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project delivers a complete **voice authentication platform** that verifies users by their voice in real time — with spoof detection, low latency, and flexible deployment across web and CLI environments.

Use it for:
- Secure login prototypes
- Research on biometric security
- Enterprise‑grade demos and integrations

## 🔁 Feature Flow

### 1️⃣ Audio Capture & Preprocessing
- Capture via **Web Audio API** (web) or **sounddevice** (CLI)
- Convert to **16 kHz mono PCM**, normalize, and package for WebSocket transmission

### 2️⃣ Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket protocol** ensures full‑duplex, low‑latency streaming
- Optimized for responsiveness and scalability

### 3️⃣ Voice Authentication Pipeline
```
Incoming Audio → Speaker Recognition → Spoof Detection → Similarity Comparison → Access Decision
```

#### 🗣️ Speaker Recognition (ECAPA-TDNN)
- Model: `speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb`
- Extracts embeddings and compares via **cosine similarity**

#### 🧪 Spoof Detection (ML‑Based)
- Random Forest classifier with 17 handcrafted audio features (MFCCs, spectral flatness, RMS variance, etc.)
- Flags replay/synthetic voice attacks

#### 🧮 Similarity Comparison
- **Cosine similarity** threshold: 0.80 (configurable)
- ≥ 0.80 → ✅ ACCESS_GRANTED
- < 0.80 → ❌ ACCESS_DENIED
